## Setup

- SQLite has been used as database
- You can change connection string from *appsettings.json* within *aspnetcore.ntier.API*
- Apply database migrations to create the tables. From a command line :

Go into aspnetcore.ntier.DAL class library. Please make sure proper versions of[.NET SDK](https://automapper.org/) and [dotnet-ef](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet) tool has been installed
```
cd aspnetcore.ntier.DAL
```
Apply database changes.
If you are using SQLite then database file with .db extension should be created inside aspnetcore.ntier.API project
```
dotnet ef --startup-project ../aspnetcore.ntier.API database update --context AspNetCoreNTierDbContext
```
## Authentication

- Authentication has been added for version 2 endpoints.
- Non auth endpoints require JWT token to be provided otherwise 401 response will be returned
- So you have to login or register first in order to get the JWT token then add it to the header while sending a request. It can be done by:
  - Clicking lock icon next to the particular endpoint and pasting token in the textbox on swagger page
  - Adding token for the ```Authorization``` header of the request
- You can disable authentication for endpoints by removing ```Authorize``` attribute from the particular controller

## Versioning

- URL versioning has been implemented and currently there are 2 versions.
- Versions can be changed via Swagger page or by providing version number in the URL.
